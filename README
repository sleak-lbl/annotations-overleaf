Our sections, key points and how to arrange them all for a nice, coordinated flow:

- (intro.tex) context, problem we are trying to solve   (aim for 1 page)
     - key point is the summary statement

- (requirements.tex) requirements for the solution  (aim for 1 page)
     - key point is the list of identified requirements
        1. agnostic
        2. require no a priori knowledge of other collection and 
           annotation efforts 
        3. decentralized
        4. low risk,effort
        5. support advice from disparate sources
        6. support discovery and filtering with related components

- (solution.tex) our approach:  (aim 3 pages, might go to 4)

     (v short outline, then sections:)

     - (solution-01.tex) rdf vocab (1 page)
          - bit of rdf background
          - diagram and description of key elements
        (what is key point?)

     - (solution-02.tex) annotation schema (1 page)
          - diagram? and description of key elements
            (diagram of how annotations reduce the massive 
            data volume to a tractable subset)
         - splitting of physical, router and link architecture as ways to search a non-trivally-hierarchical
           arcitecture for related components
        (what is key point?)


     - (solution-03.tex) summary of the tools/ prototypes (1 page)
          - python module for building, maintaining and using a 
            graph, and some prototype tools to help cataloging 
            data and searching the graph
          - get.py utility providing a user-friendy interface to the annotation
            schema for some common query patterns
           (wraps the sql and provides output formatting)
        (what is key point?)

- (methodology.tex) testing the approach: populating a graph and an annotation databasea (1 page)

     - indexing the mutrino dataset with logs tool (if I can demo it ..) 

     - populating an annotations database with machine-geneerated annotions from Baler
       (recall that annotations might be human oversavations, results of analysis tools,
       etc)

- (examples.tex) case studies using the tool prototypes and sample schemas (3 pages) (1 each) 

   - (examples-01.tex) job impact - "what hapened during my job" - find annotated events corresponding to the 
     timeframe of the job and the components it utilized
        key point: separation of non-sensitive annotations from sensitive logs 
            allows operational failure analysis in a less stringent security domain

   - hsn congestion - identifying a surprising degree of cngestion for the system and 
     searching for "what jobs/applications were causing this revealed the surprising answer 
     of "no jobs  are suspects", but highlighted issues with a specific node
        key point - filtering data volume and combining sources enables surprising discoveries

   - investigation into rererouting exposed that reroutes were failing, why? found 
     problem comoonent and identified an OOM
        - key point ?

(conclusions.tex)


try to get diagams on same page as descriptions of them


aiming at about 10 pages? icluding diagrams, and easy to read (so summarize things into key 
point cllouts? (but maybe just box them, with white background? or, just bold certain 
parapgraphs?
