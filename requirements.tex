\section{Requirements for a Solution}
\label{s:requirements}

Key points:

\begin{itemize}
\item the diversity of available data must be allowed for
\begin{itemize}
\item coercing people to do their data collection in a particular format
      or storage isn't going to work, because:
      
\begin{enumerate}
\item if the ``blessed'' format requires reformatting from the data source
      and does not benefit their investigation, they'll simply stop 
      advertising that they have the data
\item a ``blessed'' centralized storage requires someone to maintain it,
      and this person (or group) must commit to maintaining support for 
      data feeds over which they have no control. (How do they know that 
      the data going in is in a useful format, at useful cadence, and
      won't overwhelm the capacity of their system?)
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\item the diversity of expertise must be allowed for, and taken advantage of.

      ie, combining annotations from diverse experts with logs from diverse 
      sources is important
      
\item ad-hoc investigation must be supported:
\begin{itemize}
\item people are going to do it anyway, might as well make good use of it
\item ad-hoc investigators don't have the luxury of time to "clean" their 
      data to make it useful for others without a specific motivating 
      request that provides guidance and incentive
      (eg: if I have collected a bunch of Slurm queue data, and my colleague 
      asks "can you help me setup a feed of how jobs from group xyz are moving 
      through the queue?", then I'll be inclined to munge my storage into a 
      format supporting that query, but otherwise, I prefer to leave it in the 
      format that is working for me and requires no extra effort from me)
\end{itemize}

\item people are time-constrained

\item there is too much data from too many sources for anyone to keep track of

\item data must be discoverable 

\item case studies - not doing remote yet, that is in the larger architecture though

\item not a generalized interface to slurm, baler, etc, for the moment we're putting things directly into sqlite

\item (arch supports plugin interfaces)


\end{itemize}
