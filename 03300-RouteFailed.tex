\subsection{Root Cause Diagnosis}
\label{s:route}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Another network investigation started with a search for annotations involving the word ''route''.
We were expecting to see events about reroutes triggered as a result of component failure. More interesting
are cases where the reroute failed. Query output is shown in Figure~\ref{f:routeq}.

\begin{figure*}
\begin{annol}
# query for annotations where any text field contains the word 'route'

\end{annol}
\caption{Output of query for route annotations. Complete output = 15 annotations. Occurrences of network reroutes and failures in the rerouting process are of interest.}
\label{f:routeq}
\end{figure*}
%752254	acg	2015-05-08 07:35:42	2015-05-08 07:35:42	Setting alerts due to failures. A network reroute is required	nlrd	NE	["unknown"]	498

Note that the annotation in red \texttt{Setting alerts due to failures. A network reroute is required} makes clear that there has been a failure and what the next step in the response will be. It appears that 3 failures occurred that require network reroutes to recover and two of the computations of those routes failed.

To understand why the route computation failed, we query for annotations during a time frame proceeding the event, limiting the options to network (NE) annotations only.
Query output is shown in Figure~\ref{f:routNEq}. There are only 24 total annotations as opposed to the raw log lines which total over 238,000.
It is clear from the annotations, that the component triggering the problem was \texttt{c0-0c0s9a0} and that
while the recovery operation for a failed link was successful (green), that the
failure of the reroute was due a problem in adding the blade back to the HSN (to include it in the routing) (orange).

\caption{Output of query for network related annotations to investigate the cause of the failed routes. Complete output = 24 annotations.

\end{figure*}

This, thus drives us to investigate problems with \texttt{c0-0c0s9}. Query output is shown in figure~\ref{f:c0-0c0s9q}. The full output has 90 annotation, but there
are only a few distinct ones (shown).  Messages pertaining to the node (e.g, Error getting power status)(cyan) occur for all nodes on the blade and repeats (multiple nodes and repeats
suppressed). There is an out-of-memory killer annotation (red) that occurs repeatedly (repeats suppressed in the figure). Of particular interest, is that the
out of memory problem is reported by the blade controller (file is controllermessages and component is the blade), as opposed to a user process being killed by
the OOM killer on a node.

\caption{Output of query for annotations to investigate the cause of the component failure. Complete output = 90 annotations, about 10 of which are distinct. For example, the
node-related annotations occur for each node on the blade and many repeat in time and are suppressed in the figure. An OOM killer event occurs which is reported by the blade
controller, not a node.}

\end{figure*}


Finally, we are interested in determining if this problem got resolved and how. We utilize the depth search
\texttt{-d 1} to query parents (\texttt{c0-0c0}), children (the nodes and Aries), and any unknown/supremum components.
The depth and time range currently
are chosen by trial and error, however from output in Figure~\ref{f:routeresolution} it is clear that the OOM messages continue until a unsuccessful attempt is made to power
down the blade (orange), and a few attempts are necessary to rebooted the system (red) and clear the alert (green). This case also illustrates
the endstate field (which is automatically populated with the end state of commands in the command file (described in Section~\ref{s:annotations}))
as well as the manual attribution to any annotations of events from the \texttt{command} file and \texttt{p0-XXX} directories. The latter are
attributed to a generic \texttt{adm} for the annotation, as opposed to the human annotation of the blade reseating in the previous example.
