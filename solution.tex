\section{Our Approach}
\label{s:solution}

Our solution integrates three contributions to address these requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item An RDF vocabulary for describing log and monitoring data collections
      in terms of the subject being monitored, the time period covered,
      the type and format of the data and details for accessing the data or
      contacting its curator.
      
      The defining characteristic of a \texttt{ConcreteLog} - that is, a 
      specific file/stream/block-of-data being described - in the vocabulary
      is that it has a \emph{subject} - ie what the log reports on - and 
      that its entries have associated temporal information. This is a 
      sufficiently broad definition to cover all log-like collections
      while providing dimensions for a search to operate in.
      
\item A schema for publishing annotations, linked to log data, in an SQL
	  database. Annotations might be:
      
\begin{itemize}
\item Expert commentary, such as ``this log message means that down links
      caused the network to be quiesced while re-calculating routing tables''      
\item Human observations, such as ``during this period our engineer was 
      replacing some failed nodes, so the network was probably disrupted'' 
\item Machine-generated observations, such as message-pattern frequencies 
      computed by running certain logs through an analysis tool such as 
      Baler\textcolor{red}{cite}.
\end{itemize}

      The schema includes fields for the  components and the time period to 
      which each annotation applies, allowing annotation sets to also be 
      described with the RDF vocabulary

\item A collection of tools to make the RDF vocabulary and annotation 
      schema accessible to users, system administrators and support staff.

      While nothing prevents annotators and researchers from directly 
      annotating, describing and querying collections with SQL and RDF, 
      the learning curve for these technologies presents an entry 
      barrier to the time-constrained individuals who would otherwise
      benefit from it. 
      
      Many interactions with annotated, discoverable log data can be 
      can be described in just a few use cases:
      
\begin{itemize}
\item Cataloging a collection to make it discoverable
\item Annotating specific logs, either to add expert commentary to 
      entries of interest or to associate human observations with log 
      entries, log subjects or time periods
\item Finding data relevant to a subject and time period of interest
\item Extracting slices of logs associated with specific annotations, 
      or periods and subjects of interest
\end{itemize}

     The diversity of data sources and formats mean that these use cases 
     can be extended almost indefinitely, and providing a generalized 
     interface to every conceivable HPC component and data format is 
     not the goal here (see philosophy point \textcolor{red}{X}). We 
     do, however, provide an extensible tooling infrastructure and tools
     for some basic and common scenarios.

\end{enumerate}
