We show use of the annotations using the prototype implementation and tools. Examples
demonstrate the utility of the annotations in understanding
event occurrences and in problem diagnosis. They demonstrate that
the search space is greatly reduced from the whole log files, yet
the key events are revealed. They show how the annotations can be
used to drive further analysis in the log files. They show that
the descriptions can provide contextual information needed
for understanding events, thus lowering the barrier of
expert knowledge needed for understanding log events.

In these examples, we have presented our annotations in their current
state -- including typos and uncertainties in the interpretations.
We expect that this will be reflective of the annotations
in operation, with annotations evolving as additional authors
weigh in and additional expertise is obtained.

Note that some columns in the figures of annotation queries have been suppressed due to space
constraints. We explicitly retain the \texttt{balerpatternid} in the columns as this makes it easier
for the reader to associate individual instances of annotations of the same underlying event type
(e.g., same log message expect for a different component at a different time).
Colors in figures containing annotations are used to help call out annotations
referred to in the text.
